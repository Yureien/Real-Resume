# Real Resume

The rationale while creating this project was pretty clear: that you’re way more than what ends up in one piece of paper. So we began the quest of finding the “Real Resumes”. That's why we’re asking IIT Kharagpur's students and alumni to submit “Real Resumes” where they answer prompts about who they are outside of their resume.

Built with :heart: and SvelteKit.

Deployed with CloudFlare Pages.

## Installation

1. Use Node.js v16 or v18
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

Simple, isn't it?
